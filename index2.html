          <p>My name is Brad Karulas, well actually my first name is really Boris. It’s a long story, but just so you know I will respond to either. For the past 10 years I have been working as a Systems Administrator for a financial company. </p>
          <p>I went to University of Western Ontario studying Geography, then moved on to Centennial College where I studied Computer Network Engineering. Most recently I am working on full stack development certificate from the University of Toronto continuing education.</p>
          <p>When I a not on my computer you can usually find me at home with my two amazing kids, on the ice playing hockey with buddies or on the links playing golf when I can break away for a few hours (which is almost impossible). I am a sports enthusiast and you will always catch me routing for the home team.</p>
